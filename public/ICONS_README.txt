ICONS REQUIRED
==============

Please add the following icon files to this directory:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)
3. favicon.ico

You can create these icons with a simple design representing land measurement
(e.g., a ruler, map, or field icon with green/blue colors).

Online tools to create icons:
- https://favicon.io/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.canva.com/

For now, the app will work without these, but they enhance the PWA experience.
